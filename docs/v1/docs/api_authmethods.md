# Auth method API Calls

## [POST] Manage Auth Methods - Create New Auth Method

This request creates a new auth method for the given service type. The type of the auth method
as well as some of its predefined fields will be decided by the service-type's `auth_method` and `type `fields.
E.g. for a service-type of type `ams` with an auth_method of type `api-key`, it will create an api-key auth method
with predeclared fields for `path` and `retrieval_field` that are common across all type `ams` service-types.
Of course you can always override the default's if you like.

## API Key Auth methods
#### Fields

- path: Combined with the `host` and the `port` is represents the URL where the external resource is located. We use it to map the x509 certificate or any other auth mechanism to the needed token
- access_key: In the case of an api-key method, the access key specifies te `key` to use in order to access the external resource

### Request

```
POST /v1/service-types/{Name}/authm`
```


### Example request
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  "https://{URL}/v1/service-types/{Name}/authm?key={key_in_the_config}"
```

### Post Body

            "port": 9000,
        }
```

## Headers Auth methods
#### Fields

- path: Combined with the `host` and the `port` is represents the URL where the external resource is located. We use it to map the x509 certificate or any other auth mechanism to the needed token
