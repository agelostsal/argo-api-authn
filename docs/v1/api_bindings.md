# Binding API Calls

This documentation file contains guidelines in order to interact with the binding entity.

A binding, is a structure that maps various forms of authentication to the credentials of a service type's "user" entity.

For example, a service type's "user", requires an api token to authenticate to its respective service type. This token should be either
 
remembered by the "user" or retrieved using some form of credentials.
 
 A binding will hold additional information like a DN or an OIDC Token, that can be used to retrieve the required api token.
 
 A binding is associated with the uuid of a service type,the host on which this service type runs on,
 
 It also requires the unique_key that the service type that is associated with, uses in order to expose its "user's" information.
